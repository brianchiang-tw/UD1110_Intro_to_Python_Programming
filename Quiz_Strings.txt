Q1:
Fix the Quote

Code:

# TODO: Fix this string!
ford_quote = 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can\'t--you\'re right.'

print( ford_quote)



Q2:
Weâ€™ve already seen that the type of objects will affect how operators work on them. What will be the output of this code?

coconut_count = "34"
mango_count = "15"
tropical_fruit_count = coconut_count + mango_count
print(tropical_fruit_count)

Ans:
3415 (and tropical_fruit_count is a string)



Q3:
Write a Server Log Message

Code:

username = "Kinari"
timestamp = "04:50"
url = "http://petshop.com/pets/mammals/cats"

# TODO: print a log message using the variables above.
# The message should have the same format as this one:
# "Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20."

print( username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + "." )



Q4:
Length of name

Code

given_name = "William"
middle_names = "Bradley"
family_name = "Pitt"

name_length = len(given_name)+len(middle_names) + len(family_name) + 2#todo: calculate how long this name is

# Now we check to make sure that the name fits within the driving license character limit
# Nothing you need to do here
driving_license_character_limit = 28
print(name_length <= driving_license_character_limit)



Q5:
We've just used the len function to find the length of strings. What does the len function return when we give it the integer 835 instead of a string?

Ans:
Error

Hint:
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
