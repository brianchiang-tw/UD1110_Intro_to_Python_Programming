In this course, we use Python version 3 (or simply Python 3). 

If you'd like more details on previous versions of Python and how version 3 differs from previous versions, check out the History of Python on Wikipedia. 

If you're new to Python or programming in general, this article will make more sense after you've completed a lesson or two, so you may want to hold off for now. 

All you need to know now is that your solution code for the programming exercises in this course will be graded based on Python 3 code.
